Here¬†you¬†will find all the aggregated data for an awesome list. Each JSON file has the same structure but with the difference that the items of the data list change based on the list (see the related¬†[scheme](../scheme)¬†to know the fields of the object):

```json
{
  "data": [
    {},
    {},
    {}
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total": 3,
    "update_at": "UTC Timestamp"
  }
}
```

**WARNING**:¬†**opensource.json**

> This file,¬†in addition to aggregating the [open-source](../awesome/opensource/data) list's data, adds¬†the meta-data and repository statistics (only for GitHub projects) for each project by inserting them in the autogenerated field (the data are updated every month).

**WARNING**:¬†**languages.json**

> This file contains statistics relating to the languages used by open-source projects both in byte format and in percentage.
